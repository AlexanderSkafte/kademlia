# Kademlia in Go

**Note: this is a work in progress. Not usable for production. Personal project!**

The implementation is based various descriptions available online, including but not limited to

- [The Kademlia Whitepaper](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf)
- [The Wikipedia article on Kademlia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia)
- [Kademlia: A Design Specification (XLattice)](http://xlattice.sourceforge.net/components/protocol/kademlia/specs.html)

The project still requires thorough testing as well as further work on the implementation.
